The Superhuman Coalition
The year is 2037...

In the year 2036, human explorers on Mars discovered the remains of ancient Precursor technology - a nanovirus designed to extensively modify the human body and mind. Experiments on convicted criminals showed the effects to include incredibly high strength, perception, agility, intelligence, industriousness and reproductive rates, as well as the ability to turn into vapor at will, live in any environment known to science and posess complete immortality. The minds of such individuals were more akin to computers than living organisms - while integrating the personality of the original body, it changed it to be more agreeable, cooperative, as well as making it operate on pure logic and completely lack resistance to computerized implants.

Soon, this technology was given out to all of humanity, turning it into a collection of immortal cyborg superhumans almost overnight. With the intelligence and cooperation provided by the nanovirus, all the problems of the world, including the ones we didn't know we had were solved within six months. Functional light-speed interstellar travel was discovered last week.

It is your responsibility as the Leader to utilize this incredible power given to humanity to ensure it a worthy place in the galaxy. After all, with such advantages, what could possibly go wrong?
